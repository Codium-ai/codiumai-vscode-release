#### Explore behavior coverage

CodiumAI generates a behavior list of your code and marks each behavior as covered or not covered based on the generated test.
The coverage percentages are calculated by the number of covered behaviors.
You can refresh the coverage when you modify your test suite (add, remove, or modify tests):

#### Add test for uncovered behavior

For behaviors that are not covered by tests, you can click on the "Generate test" button next to it, and CodiumAI will generate a test
for this behavior.
