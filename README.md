1. After installation, you should receive a notification on the bottom of the VSCode editor. Click "Sign in" button in the notification popup to activate Codium with your GitHub account. If you can't see the notification on the bottom right of the editor window, click the button labeled Codium in the bottom status bar.

2. You will be redirected to the GitHub login page.

3. Once you confirm the activation you should be redirected back to the editor. Status notification should show your GitHub username when the activation was successful.

4. Open existing Python file or write a new Python class/function and press the "Generate Tests" on top of the class/function.

5. A new tab will open in your VSCode IDE with the generated tests, along with your code analysis, test plan, and test code.

6. Modify the test style in the Plan Instructions dropdown and re-generate tests in the new style.

7. Modify the test cases list to fully control generated tests. Remove the cases you don't need, add suggested cases from the "Additional Test Cases" list, and add your own test cases. After each edit re-generate tests to get a new list of test code.

8. "Accept" to add the generated tests to a new file.

> Tip 1: If you can't see the `Generate Tests` button you might have to set `"editor.codeLens": true,` in your VSCode configuration file.
> <br>

> Tip 2: You can show and hide Codium panel in the extension settings or from the command palette.
> <br>

> Pro Tip: Edit the test strategies and redo tests to improve the quality of the next tests generation.
